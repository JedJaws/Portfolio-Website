                    <p>This was an introductory website strictly using Bootstrap. This was project that was semi guided by Udemy but ultimately recreated alone by myself. The website layout was strictly from templates and examples on the Bootstrap website. To which I applied it to my own and edited some of its features. While teaching me how to utilize the resources of Bootstrap, I was able to learn how to utilize its syntax.</p>

From the initial three boxes alone to its contents within the box as well. This was also an introduction to the use of media queries.</p>
